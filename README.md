# Face-Detection
I here use python and machine learning to do the project on face detection
In this you need to run recognization.py file using terminal or command prompt
You need to have following packages to run this Project
  1.) Python 3.5 or greater  
      You can download using pip command
      pip install python3.5   or  3.6 (its upto you which version you want)
  2.) Scipy
      pip install scipy
      pip install scikit-image
  3.) Numpy
      In python numpy is already install you need to update it
      pip install -U numpy
  4.) Dlib
      pip install dlib

Thats It...
Happy Working
